## Description ðŸ“–
This repository contains two Blender projects that explore different texturing approaches for the same 3D model. One project uses various free texture resources from Blender Kit, while the other employs simple custom textures for improved compatibility.

## Projects Included ðŸ“‚
- **Simple Whack A Mole (Custom Materials)**: Uses simple custom textures for better compatibility with Unity.
- **Space Whack A Mole (Free Source Materials)**: Uses various free texture resources from Blender Kit with complex node setups.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»
- **3D Modeling**: Blender 4.1

## Using Blender Models in Unity ðŸŽ®
1. **Import FBX to Unity**: Open Unity and drag the FBX files from the `WhackAMole_Assets_FBX` folders into the Assets folder.
2. **Modify as Needed**: Further customize the models and materials within Unity for your project requirements.
